Watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbSee-XM7WA&t=1505s&pp=ygUIRERBIGluIEM%3D) video I wanted to understand raytracing a little bit better by making another small game. This will also allow me to understand the graphical library a little better and improve fundamental skills for programming (experimenting and testing without having a guide or end result). 

I hope this will not take longer than one week. For today, I merely want to install the graphical library, open a window and have a gridline drawn based on a map.
