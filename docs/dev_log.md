Watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbSee-XM7WA&t=1505s&pp=ygUIRERBIGluIEM%3D) video I wanted to understand raytracing a little bit better by making another small game. This will also allow me to understand the graphical library a little better and improve fundamental skills for programming (experimenting and testing without having a guide or end result). 

I hope this will not take longer than one week. For today, I merely want to install the graphical library, open a window and have a gridline drawn based on a map.

Worked my way through. Program now can fill in the grid with a square and remove it if clicked again.
Thinking about the cursor I learned about static and dynamic images in mlx library. At the moment I have one image that I update and push to the screen but apparently you can also sort of have layers by having different images that you can push to the window. I would like to learn a little bit more about this so I don't have to constantly draw the entire image to the screen everytime the cursor moves.

Some things I would like to implement for next session:

- Adding a little round circle that follows the mouse.
- Adding another little circle that can be moved through the wasd buttons.

Most likely I will learn about layering in tomorrows session!
